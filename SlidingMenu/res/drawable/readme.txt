**		The Dota 2 Icons		**
**************************************************

This Dota 2 Icon set is in no means complete.
As time goes by I will try to pick images from the
Internet which I think is worthy of using as an
icon. A lot of images on the Internet are just
not suited for the purpose.

If you have a suggested image (preferrably large),
feel free to point me to the direction and I will
try to use it as the hero icon. You can give me
the link (throw me a comment) at
http://dokgu.com/dota-2-icons/.

The icon set is free to use personally or
commercially without any restrictions. No credits
are necessary but I would appreciate it if you do.

By downloading this, you agree that you are not
allowed to directly distribute the icon set
individually or in pack. If you want to share the
icons, feel free to direct them to
http://dokgu.com/dota-2-icons/ as I intend to have
the icon set exclusively downloadable on my
website.

If you liked my work, also consider donating an
amount you are most willing to donate which you
can do on my website as well.

Thank you and have a nice day!
